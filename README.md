# SimpleStateMachine
###by Ashley Woon

An Arduino sketch, it explores LED complexity and state machine. Pressing the button four times would result in the RGB LED lighting up red. Another four presses would result in the red turning off and green lighting up. Another four presses would turn off green and turn on red, while a last four presses would turn on all three LED resulting in white. Four more presses turns all LEDs off.

A ESP32, breadboard, RGB LED, resistors, push button, and connecting wires were used.
